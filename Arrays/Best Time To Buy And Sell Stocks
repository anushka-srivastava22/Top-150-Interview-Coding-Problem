Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Solution
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = 0;
        for(int val : prices)
        {
            if(val<min)
            {
                min = val;
            }
            if(val-min>max)
            {
                max=val-min;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}

Algorithm
1. Take 2 variables as min = Max value & max = 0.
2. Run for loop as val:prices.
3. Check if val < min and if its true then assign val to min.
4. Then check if val-min>max if its true then calculate max as val - min.
5. Return max value.
