Problem 
https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Solution
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int candy[] = new int[n+1];
        candy[0] = 1;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(ratings[i-1] < ratings[i])
            {
                candy[i] = candy[i-1] + 1;
            }
            else if(ratings[i-1] == ratings[i])
            {
                candy[i] = 1;
            }
            else 
            {
                candy[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--)
        {
            if(ratings[i-1] > ratings[i] && candy[i-1] < candy[i] + 1)
            {
                candy[i-1] = candy[i] + 1;
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            res+=candy[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
