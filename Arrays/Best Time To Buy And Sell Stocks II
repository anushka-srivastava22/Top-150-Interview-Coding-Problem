Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Solution 
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<prices.length;i++)
        {
            if(prices[i]>prices[i-1]) 
            {
                profit+=prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}

Algorithm
1. Initialize profit=0.
2. Run for loop from i=1 to length of array.
3. Check if value of prices at i position is greater than value of prices at i-1 position then add the difference of their values in profit.
4. Return profit.
