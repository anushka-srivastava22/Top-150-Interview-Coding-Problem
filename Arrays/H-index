Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

Solution
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;
   
        int idx = 0 ;

        while(idx < n &&  n-idx >citations[idx]){
            idx++;
        }

        return n-idx;
    }
}

Algorithm 
1. Sort the array.
2. Find the length of array.
3. Run while loop till index < n and n-index > value at index of citation array.
4. Increase the index.
5. Return n-index.
