Problem Statement

https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/

Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

The path starts with a single slash '/'.
Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
Return the simplified canonical path.


Solution

class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        String parts[]=path.split("/");
        StringBuilder spath=new StringBuilder();
        for(String part: parts)
        {
            if(part.isEmpty() || part.equals("."))
            {
                continue;
            }
            else if(part.equals(".."))
            {
                if(spath.length()>0)
                {
                    int lastindex=spath.lastIndexOf("/");
                    spath.delete(lastindex,spath.length());

                }
            }
            else
            {
                spath.append("/").append(part);

            }
        }
        if(spath.length()==0)
        {
            spath.append("/");
        }
        return spath.toString();
    }
}

Algorithm

1. Split the path and store it in parts array.
2. Create a string builder of spath.
3. Run for loop for each value of parts.
4. Check if part is empty or contains '.' then continue.
5. Then check if part contains '..' and length of spath is greater than 0 then find the last index of '/' into lastindex and delete the value of spath of lastindexand spath.length.
6. Otherwise append the spath by / and part.
7. At last check if length of spath is 0 then append / in spath.
8. Return the string value of spath.
