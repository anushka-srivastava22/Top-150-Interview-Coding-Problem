Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting 
some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Solution
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if(s.length()==0)
        {
            return true;
        }
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<s.length() && j<t.length())
        {
            if(s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j))
            {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        if(i==s.length())
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Algorithm
1. Check if length of s is 0 then return true.
2. Assign i=0,j=0.
3. Run while loop i is less than length of s and j  is less than length of t.
4. Check if character of s at i position is equal to character of t at j position then increase i.
5. Increase value of j.
6. Check if i is equal to length of s then return true.
7. Return false.
