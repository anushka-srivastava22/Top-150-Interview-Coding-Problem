Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Solution

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int count=0;
        for(int i=s.length()-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            
            if(s.charAt(i)==' ')
            {
                if(count>0)
                {
                    return count;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Algorithm
1. Assign count as 0.
2. Run for loop from length of array till 0.
3. Check if character at i index is equal to space, if its true then check if count is greater than 0, if its true then return count otherwise else increase the value of count.
4. Return value of count.
