Problem Statement
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Solution 
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        Set<String> set=new HashSet<>();
        for(int i=0;i<=8;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<=8;j++)
            {
                char n = board[i][j];
           
            if(n!='.')
            {
                if(!(set.add(n+"r"+i)) || !(set.add(n+"c"+j)) || !(set.add(n+"b"+i/3+j/3)))
                {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Algorithm 
1. Create a HashSet of strings as set.
2. Run nested for loop from 0 to 8.
3. Assign the character at i and j position of board array.
4. Check if n is not equal to '.' then check if
!set.add(n + "r" + i): It tries to add a string to the HashSet formed by concatenating the number n, the letter 'r', and the current row i. 
This represents a unique identifier for a number in a row. If add returns false, it means that the same identifier (number n in the same row) has already 
been added to the HashSet, indicating a duplicate number in the same row. In this case, the Sudoku puzzle is invalid, and the function returns false.

!set.add(n + "c" + j): It tries to add a string to the HashSet formed by concatenating the number n, the letter 'c', and the current column j. This represents a
unique identifier for a number in a column. If add returns false, it means that the same identifier (number n in the same column) has already been added to the HashSet, 
indicating a duplicate number in the same column. In this case, the Sudoku puzzle is invalid, and the function returns false.

!set.add(n + "b" + i / 3 + j / 3): It tries to add a string to the HashSet formed by concatenating the number n, the letter 'b', and the box identifier i / 3 + j / 3. 
The box identifier is calculated based on the current row and column divided by 3, which determines which 3x3 subgrid (box) the number belongs to. If add returns false, 
it means that the same identifier (number n in the same box) has already been added to the HashSet, indicating a duplicate number in the same box. In this case, the Sudoku 
puzzle is invalid, and the function returns false.
5. Return true.
